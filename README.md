   cd nextjs-openai-chat
   ```

````

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install

    ```

3.  Create a `.env.local` file (see `.env.local.example`):

    ```env
    # API URL for the backend

    ```

4.  Run the development server:

## Project Status

-   âœ… Chat UI implemented

-   âœ… API integration with backend

----------

## Notes

-   Environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are **required** for use in client-side code.

-   The `.env.local` file is ignored by git. Use `.env.local.example` as a template for configuration.

-   For a complete experience, ensure the backend server is running and accessible.

-   DaisyUI provides prebuilt components and themes for styling.
